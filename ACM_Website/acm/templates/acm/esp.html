                        <p class="card-text">With an increase in usage of the Internet, there has been an exponential increase in the use of online social media on the Internet. Websites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tinder, YouTube, and many others have changed the way the Internet is being used. There is a dire need to investigate, measure, and understand privacy and security on online social media from various perspectives (computational, cultural, psychological). Real-world scalable systems need to be built to detect and defend security and privacy issues on online social media. Projects currently being implemented in IIITD, in the areas of (Mis)Information / Fake content on Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp; Linking profiles across different social networks; Selfie deaths and KillFies; and Manipulated followers will be discussed. Information regarding public usage of tools and datasets used for research at IIITD will be shared in due process. The usage of the link between Computational Social Science, Data Science, Statistics, and Network Science to conduct research will also be elucidated. An interactive session discussing general queries regarding the topic and upcoming research opportunities will follow the technical talk.</p>
